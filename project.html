                 Honda’s small SUV model gets top marks. “The CR-V is one of the better</br>
                 models among small SUVs, thanks to its roomy cabin, good fuel economy,</br>
                 and competent handling,” according to Consumer Reports.</br>
                 The car’s handling is “nimble and surefooted,” while the ride itself impressive</br>
                 comfortable with little road noise. Plus, the model gets 28 mpg overall.</br>

                 With an upgraded entertainment system that Consumer Reports says is</br>
                 a “big improvement,” the Honda Accord also gets points for its</br> 
                 “coupe-like silhouette” and a slick transmission. “Handling is</br>
